# Pacman Game in Assembly

A simple Pacman game developed I deveoped in x86 Assembly using the Irvine32 library for my semester project. I have also added the problem statement. 

## Features

- Movement using WASD keys
- Dot collection and scoring
- Ghost enemies
- Multiple levels
- Basic sound effects (if enabled via Irvine)

## Requirements

- Visual Studio with MASM support
- Irvine32 Library (irvine32.inc, irvine32.lib, kernel32.lib)
- Windows OS

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure Irvine32 library is properly installed on your system.
3. Open the `pacman-irvine.sln` file in Visual Studio.
4. Click on **Local Windows Debugger** to build and run the game.

## Controls

- W: Move Up  
- A: Move Left  
- S: Move Down  
- D: Move Right  
- P: Pause  
- X: Exit  

## Objective

- Eat all the dots to score points.
- Avoid ghosts or you lose lives.
- Complete all levels to win.

## Notes

- Make sure Irvine32 files are linked correctly in project settings.
- Use only on systems with proper Irvine32 setup.
